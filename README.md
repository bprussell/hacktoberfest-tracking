# Hacktoberfest Tracking Dashboard

A fun, over-engineered SPA to track progress and PRs during Hacktoberfest. Live production app is hosted here: https://hacktoberfest-tracking.vercel.app/

## Technology Summary

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) extension is recommended.

## Contributing

### What you need to get started

- Supabase access
  - You'll need to sign up for a Supabase account with a Github account, then Chris can send you an invitation to the email associated with your Github
- Environment variables (put these in a .env file), specifically `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - These can be found in the Hacktoberfest Tracking 2022 project in Supabase under Settings > Api

Get in touch with Chris and he'll get you set up with these variables and credentials

### Workflow

Open issues can be found [here](https://github.com/ubercj/hacktoberfest-tracking/issues). If you see an issue you'd like to tackle, please comment on the issue first to signal your intent and make sure two people don't end up working on the same issue without knowing. Then, make a feature branch and submit a PR with your changes. One passing review (you can tag Chris) is required before it can be merged to main.

If you have any questions or suggestions about anything, feel free to reach out to Chris
